These are all reproduction results for the investigation into the unique predictive power of proximal (sample entropy) and distal (effort-to-compress) variables when inserted into the same ordinal logistic regression. 

Within each are omnibus brant's test p-value, Ordinal logistic regression p-value, regression coefficient and odds ratio . 

There are the results for two network granularities (126 and 553 parcels) 

GS = global signal regression 
HP = High pass filter
COS = Cosine distance
CB = City Block; AKA, Manhattan distance
IPS = instantenous phase synchrony.
