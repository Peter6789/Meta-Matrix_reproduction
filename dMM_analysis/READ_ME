These are all reproduction results for dMM  analysis (See fig 2 in main text). 

Within each are omnibus brant's test p-value, Ordinal logistic regression p-value, regression coefficient , odds ratio and the confidence interavals (low and high). 

There are the results for two network granularities (126 and 553 parcels) for two different defintions of the dMM (i.e., removing 13 or 24 proximal/autocorrelational timepoints). See main text for further description
GS = global signal regression 
HP = High pass filter
COS = Cosine distance
CB = City Block; AKA, Manhattan distance
IPS = instantenous phase synchrony. 
RAM_VECTORISED= Using pearson correlation as a distance metric, sliding window and aCompCorr (see S2 or methods); Cambridge anaesthesia dataset
LON_VECTORISED = alternative anaesthesia dataset (LONDON, ONTARIO), preprocessed as RAM_VECTORISED


NB: *_VECTORISED
This is alternative reproduction of results when measures were calculated on the whole vectorised dMM rather than on each column separately.
