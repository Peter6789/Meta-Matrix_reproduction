These are all reproduction results across methodological contingencies for the effects of the cortex subcortex and cerebellum for proximal and distal measures when inserted in the same ordinal logistic regression as covariates. 

Within each are omnibus brant's test p-value, Ordinal logistic regression p-value, regression coefficient , and odds ratios. 


GS = global signal regression 
HP = High pass filter
COS = Cosine distance
CB = City Block; AKA, Manhattan distance
IPS = instantenous phase synchrony. 

COR= cortex
SUB= subcortex
CEREB= Cerebllum

OR= odds ratio
COEF= coefficient 
P = P-value
Bra= Brant's test p-value (omnibus presented)
