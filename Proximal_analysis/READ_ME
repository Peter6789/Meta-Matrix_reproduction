Within each are omnibus brant's test p-value, Ordinal logistic regression p-value, regression coefficient , odds ratio and the confidence interavals (low and high). 

There are the results for two network granularities (126 and 553 parcels) for three different models (refer to methods)

GS = global signal regression 
HP = High pass filter
Cosine = Cosine distance
Manhattan = Manhattan distance
IPS = instantenous phase synchrony.
