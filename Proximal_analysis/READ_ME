These are all reproduction results for proximal time similairty analysis (See fig 2 in main text). 

Within each are omnibus brant's test p-value, Ordinal logistic regression p-value, regression coefficient , odds ratio and the confidence interavals (low and high). 

There are the results for two network granularities (126 and 553 parcels) for three different models (refer to methods)

GS = global signal regression 
HP = High pass filter
Cosine = Cosine distance
Manhattan = Manhattan distance
IPS = instantenous phase synchrony. 
aCOMPCORR_RAM= Using pearson correlation as a distanc4e metric, sliding window and aCompCorr (see S2 or methods); Cambridge anaesthesia dataset
aCOMPCORR_LON = alternative anaesthesia dataset (LONDON, ONTARIO), preprocessed as aCOMPCORR_RAM


NB: *_OTHER_TIMEPOINTS
This has an extra parameter which multiples results by 3. We varied the number of timepoints where between proximal transitions and averaged results over the various distances. 
So, number timepoints = 6, indicates that we took the diagonal vectors (see fig 2 in main text) of the firsat subdiagonal, the second subdiagonal and so on till the 6th. 
We calculated the relevant metrics over all these and then averaged the resulting values. Number_timepoints =1 is what we report in the main text (for the lower granularity parcellation)
